                            <p>Between 22. April and 20. May 2020, under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 20 participants of the online class, “Getting Personal: A Hands-On Guide to Making Personal Games” learned how to use personal games to convey their experiences in interactive and playful ways. Offering insight into a variety of tools and methods to help participants get started designing their own games, the sessions led by artist Marie Claire LeBlanc Flanagan, producer Lorenzo Pilia, game-designer Bahiyya Khan, and Rachel Uwa, founder of School of Machines, focused on storytelling, playing, and addressing inner hopes and anxieties while doing so.</p>

<p><b>Inner Thoughts and Personal Memories</b></p>
<p>“Attending this class saved my quarantine. I won’t say my life, to avoid sounding too dramatic, although I believe it’s true. It helped me <b>discover a whole new fascinating world</b> that felt perfectly aligned with my previous interests and ways of expression,” confesses Katerina Magarini, an architect and new media artist based in Athens, Greece, who prepared no less than 3 games during these five weeks.</p></br>

<p>“I was always interested in personal history and electronic literature, as well as creating interactive and playful experiences, but I wasn’t aware of personal games as a genre. Discovering it made me feel like I finally found <b>a space where inner thoughts, feelings and memories are free to exist</b> on their own terms. Spending so many hours at home was the perfect timing to dive into this universe, explore really touching games and experiment with new tools to communicate what I was experiencing. I explored Twine using recent material I had from adopting a mannequin from the trash and I ended up making a game about missing affection.”</p></br>

<p>“When we were asked to make a game about breakfast, I discovered that sharing my everyday eating habits turned out to <b>capture my whole reality</b> at this specific time.”</p></br>

<p>Concerning the personal game called “5 am”, she adds, “The fact that my sleeping schedule was messed up reminded me of my university years, when <b>I used to enjoy staying up until late</b>, feeling that the early morning hours were completely mine. On a night like this, I decided to make my final game about it, as a tribute to my most personal hour of the day.”</p>

<p>Checking in from Mexico, another participant, Liz Rodríguez Avila is a digital and analogue creator immersed in world building and the experience of feels related to audio visual environments, and also a creative director and co-founder at <a href="https://sociedadfantasma.com/" target="_blank"> Sociedad Fantasma</a>, an animated content storytelling studio.
<p>“Expanding the connection possibilities that narration has through a videogame is something that I find interesting to explore now in my work. This online class gave me <b>tools, resources and a space to interchange ideas</b>. I've applied this knowledge in the development of my first simple game and I've also started to build a second one around a character that I have been working with.”</p></br>

<p>Liz’s “Tiny Bonfire 🐜” is a game inspired by a personal memory and it aims to emulate a happy feeling. “You are an ant in the garden, you collect sticks, put them together and <b>build a bonfire to be able to eat roasted marshmallows</b>. I decided to create a simple game, motivated by the possibility that people could perceive the feeling of happiness in it.”</p>

<p><b>Women’s Fears, Family Relationships, and Bodily Sensations</b></p>
<p>“Ever since playing Commander Keen, games have formed a big part of my life. During the course, I felt extremely inspired, with new ideas piling up after each class. Being part of a group with similar aspirations helped me stay motivated and make at least one project each week. It was especially encouraging to get <b>weekly feedback from the mentors</b> and colleagues, as well as learning about different creative processes, tools and personal games,” says Irene Preuss, who moved from Barcelona to Berlin, sneaked into the video game industry in 2017, and is currently working on her first prototype.</p>
<p>Irene's “Just in Case”, made during this class, is a horror game created in Twine <b>about being followed when getting home at night</b>. Based on a personal experience it aims to raise awareness of the lack of freedom many women face in everyday activities.</p></br>

<p>A more light-hearted work by Irene, “Sometimes when I wake up” is a short game about the process of waking up and having breakfast.</p></br>

<p>Georgian designer Adnan Arif’s “One Last Time” is a poetic goodbye of a man making one last trek into his mind to meet someone dear to him. “He does not know how he got there but <b>the only way out is to seek the answers within</b>,” Adnan explains.</p></br>

<p>“I made a personal game about my son. We are separated by circumstances and borders. He's 3 and I find it hard,” he adds, when asked about the game. “I usually do not keep any photos on display but I find it easier to remember him by making him a subject of a creative project - be it a children's book or a postcard. So, when it came to the subject of developing a game about something very personal, I was naturally drawn to making 'One Last Time' but I was also deeply conflicted about sharing something so private. I do not know whether this game will be engaging to anyone, but like with everything, I hope he sees it one day when he's older and he's <b>scavenging through my digital footprints</b> so he knows he was always on his dad's mind.”</p>

<p>“The game is a poetic mystery about a man who enters a dream state and must engage with memories of his son who he's forgotten. He also is unaware what's happening to him until the very end.”</p>


<p>Reflecting on her thoroughly personal journey through different medical exams and the investigation of her symptoms which came on suddenly during the time of the course, Maria Saridaki, a freelance cultural manager and postdoc play studies researcher based in Athens, Greece, created a game titled  “in/visible: hearing the unheard of” which explores a voyage through body scans, machine noises, and electromagnetic fields.</p>
 
<p>“As I was moving my body from mammogram to ultrasound and from MRI to CT scans, there were moments of pure bliss when I would close my eyes and <b>immerse into the connection with the elecromagnetic waves</b>, the industrial sounds and my detached body.”</p>


<img src="images/main/maria_s.jpg" width="100%" class="center">

<p>Inspired by these moments, Maria's interactive game uses ETHER by SOMA Laboratories, a tool that has electric and magnetic components for sensing radiation and electromagnetic fields: “The magnetic antenna is modeled after old long-wave radios and is the most sensitive on ETHER’s axis. Changing the positioning and orientation of ETHER will result in different sounds. ETHER antenna-pins allow you to <b>turn any conductive material (even your skin) into an external antenna</b>.”</p>

<p><b>Animal Perspectives and Interactive Poetry</b></p>
<p>Streetcat, a DIY community organizer, maker, and designer from Atlanta, United States, created “Good Meowning” based on the creative interest of storytelling human experiences through animal perspectives.</p></br>

<p>“The player character in ‘Good Meowning’ is from the perspective of a hungry cat that lives outside of a human's house. <b>The goal of the player is to wake the sleepy human</b> from their bed so the human can rip open a fresh can of tuna for breakfast.”</p>

<p>While creating a personal game, Miami-based artist and educator Fereshteh wanted to learn Twine and to <b>translate poetry into an interactive piece</b>.</p></br>

<p>“<b>I wrote a poem about games</b> called ‘Things I never knew I played’, after a Nâzım Hikmet poem called ‘Things I Didn’t Know I Loved.’ My poem is a response to the prompt to brainstorm memorable early experiences with play in Marie's (our instructor's) <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/index.html" target="_blank">‘A kind of play’ zine</a>.</p>

<p>Overall the class was a resounding success. “I loved seeing all the brilliant works of everyone in the course. I feel so grateful for everyone who helped make this class a reality, that we created space for people to reflect on their lives and dream up these amazing ideas which ultimately turned in to these beautiful personal games," said Rachel. "I’m looking forward to doing this again.”</p>
