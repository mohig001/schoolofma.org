                    <p>The class focuses on the intersection between graphic design and social issues by using hands-on and computational tools. Graphic design in contemporary society does the most effective communication in our everyday life. The class through the lens of design languages, such as shape, color, typography, geometry to describe social issues or express our concern in today’s society that we encounter every day. Topics will be around activists, boundaries, social distance, globalization, etc,  in making of sign, poster, postcard, and zine. The class will be a mix of lecture, discussion, and hands-on experience. Participants will use design as a medium to express their thinking on social issues and produce both digital visual work and physical sculptural object as zine or artist’s book. In each session, there will be space for questions, debates, conversations, workshops, show and tell. There will be weekly assignments all leading up to a final online showcase.</p>


                    <p>In recent years, the adoption of voice-enabled devices has grown significantly. It's predicted that by sometime later this year a third of all web-browsing will be done without a screen and that by 2022, more than half of households are expected to own smart devices with integrated virtual assitants. This begins to sound plausible when we consider that many people who already own and use these devices say it feels natural talking to it, with some even claiming it feels like talking to a friend.</p>

                    <p>Artificially synthesised voice brought our interactions with personal devices beyond push buttons, twisting and swiping. Nonetheless, while mediating notions of service, access to knowledge, and digital companionship, currently voice assistants are reduced to trivial, task-oriented power plays: order me this, turn on that, play these, entertain me. </p>

                    <p>The course will aim to reconsider voice assistants as subjects rather than objects and allow us to create more intimate relationships with them. Through speculative and critical design, we will temporarily detach from the limitations of existing technologies in order to speculate on what voice assistants could become. We will then set up our own open-source voice assistants and engage in home experiments enabling their training and growth towards our imagined scenarios. Finally, we will connect our devices and their knowledge into a common pool, allowing them—and us—to share with and through each other; a community network of voice assistants with its own notion of proximity and relatedness.</p>



                    <p>There will be time and space for questions, debates and conversations throughout the course.</p>

                            <p><b>Week 1: A moment to get to know each other.</b><br>


<p>This session is about getting to know each other and learning about everyone’s expectations. What brought you to this course? What is it that you hope to learn and practice? The second half of the first session will include an introduction into voice assistant technology, presenting relevant creative projects, and critical inquiries.</p>

There will be introductions of who we all are but also discussions regarding expectations and what you hope to gain from the class. The instructor will firstly lead a discussion about the topic of social issues; introduce the concept of this class; give a brief lecture about graphic design and design languages; and finally, introduce some tools we will use in the class. Students will need to be equipped with those tools with them in the next class. 



                        </p>
                                                <p>
                            <p><b>Week 2: “Boundary” Workshop</b><br>

<p>Futures and critical design exercise: What could a voice assistant become? This session will focus on generating possible and plausible briefs for ourselves through a series of creative props and constraints using speculative and critical design methodologies.</p>

This week, we will look at geometry, shape and explore the symbolical meaning of those basic shapes corresponding to our social distance, personal boundary, comfort zone, intimate relationship, culture differences, etc. After a short lecture about knowing the shapes and a hands-on programming workshop by playing these shapes in p5.js/Processing. Students will create a graphic work by only using those basic shapes to express their thinking of social distance, boundary or related topics. This in-class exercise will be continued to be the assignment for this week,  



                        </p>
                                                <p>
                            <p><b>Week 3: “Posters Occupy the Street”</b>

<p>This session will focus on the basic setup of an open-source voice assistant. In this session, we will get to work, testing, and combining some of our prepared modules. We will be using Mycroft open-source voice assistant on Linux (or Virtual Box for those using MacOS or Windows), Google Collaboratory, and Google Drive. </p>

Poster design seems the most common thing for a designer that you can think of. From the first futurism poster in the history to propaganda posters occupying the street (at some certain special times), posters occupying streets is like a city wears a T-shirt with some big statements in the center. Putting in the context of protest, the class will lead students to make a powerful sign or poster by only using typography, thinking like an activist. 


                        </p>
                                                <p>
                            <p><b>Week 4: “Make a Zine by using Office’s Copy Machine”</b><br>

<p>In this session, we will set up a machine learning environment for our voice assistant to learn from what we tell them, whether it be poetry, children’s tales, or Youtube comments. We will connect our devices into a pool, so we can access and engage with the shared knowledge.</p>

Imagining you are a teller in a bank as your day job, but after 5 pm (off work), you become a poet. To publish your fist collection/periodical, you will use the copy machine at work to produce your first zine and distribute it to your friends and fellow poets. Making a Zine is the easiest way to express and distribute, in a relatively underground way. This week, we will have a discussion about each person’s most concerning social issue at the moment. The instructor will give a brief lecture about the history of Artist’s Book, zine culture and conduct a hands-on workshop about making a simple zine/bookbinding. The student will then make a zine (a simple pamphlet) by different approaches, such as collage, drawing, digital print, cut-off, paint, etc about the topic they decided earlier throughout the discussion. They will make a few copies of the zines through a “copying machine”. The assignment starts in the class and could be finished before next week’s class’s Show & Tell. 


</p>

<p>
                            <p><b>Week 5: Show and Tell, Online Exhibition</b><br>

<p>In this final session, we will present and record our results, talk to our voice assistants and explain our training methods. We will discuss what worked, what didn’t, and what the next steps could look like. The self graph of each device will be introduced as a tool to visualise its state of being, or what it has learned so far. 
</p>

Students will present their Zine and curates past works on an online platform. This final session we’ll come together to see what everyone has made. The instructor and guest critics will offer constructive feedback through the session. The class will end here, but people could keep continuing with their on-going “Social Design” project.


<p>By the end of the course we hope for each participant to get a taste of how to yield collective learning results and how to support the emergence of collective knowledge within their own teams.</p>

During this time, we are offering a limited number of pay-what-you-can solidarity tickets for this online class.
